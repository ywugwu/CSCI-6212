# Using Clip Segmentation (ClipSeg) Model to Monitor Kidney Bean Growth


## 1. Introduction

This project aims to leverage the Clip Segmentation (ClipSeg) [1] model to monitor the growth dynamics of a kidney bean plant through time-lapse photography. 

The grown kidney bean images are obtained from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCuXNmsNNac&t=0s.
