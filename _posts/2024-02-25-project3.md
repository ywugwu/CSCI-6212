# Using Segment Anything to Monitor Kidney Bean Growth


## 1. Introduction

This project explores the growth dynamics of a kidney bean plant through time-lapse photography. Motivated by a curiosity about plant growth and development, we aim to quantify the increase in the plant's size over time using semantic segmentation. The subject of our study, the kidney bean, was chosen for its relatively fast germination and growth process, making it an ideal candidate for a time-bound project.

To visualize and analyze the growth, we employ a semantic segmentation model that segments the plant from each image in a series of time-lapse photos. By calculating the area covered by the plant in each image, we can plot this data over time to observe the growth trend.

Our methodology and findings are shared with the hope that they may contribute to educational purposes and provide insights into plant growth patterns, potentially aiding in agricultural research.

## 2. Method

### a. Data Collection

The data consists of time-lapse images of a growing kidney bean, captured at regular intervals. This approach provides a continuous visual record of the plant's development from germination to a mature stage.

### b. Semantic Segmentation

We applied a semantic segmentation model to each image to distinguish the plant from the background. This process involves the identification and labeling of pixels that belong to the kidney bean plant, allowing for the measurement of the plant's area in each image.

### c. Area Calculation

After segmenting the plant in each image, we calculated the area covered by the plant. This metric serves as a quantitative representation of the plant's growth over time.

## 3. Results

We present a plot where the x-axis represents time (or image number), and the y-axis shows the calculated area of the kidney bean plant. This visualization allows us to observe the growth pattern of the plant over the duration of the time-lapse.

## 4. Analysis of Results

The growth plot reveals insights into the growth dynamics of the kidney bean plant, including the rate of growth and any periods of significant change. We discuss the implications of our findings and any surprising elements observed during the study.

## 5. Analysis of Vision Algorithms

Our experience with the semantic segmentation model highlights its capabilities and limitations in processing the time-lapse images. We reflect on the challenges encountered, such as varying lighting conditions and the model's sensitivity to changes in the plant's shape and size.
