# Using Clip Segmentation (ClipSeg) Model to Monitor Kidney Bean Growth


## 1. Introduction

This project aims to leverage the Clip Segmentation (ClipSeg) [1] model to monitor the growth dynamics of a kidney bean plant through time-lapse photography. 

The grown kidney bean images are obtained from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCuXNmsNNac&t=0s.

## 2. Method

In this project, we utilized the ClipSeg [1] model, which combines the capabilities of both image understanding and natural language processing to perform segmentation tasks. ClipSeg takes an input image along with a text prompt and outputs a probability map that corresponds to the areas of the image described by the text prompt.

This approach allows for dynamic and flexible segmentation based on textual descriptions, enabling more accurate and relevant extraction of features from images.
Thus, we can use prompt like "plant" to monitor the growth magnitude of kidney bean in our selected video.

## 3. Results

To quantify the kidney bean's growth magnitude over time, we utilized the average value over the probability map generated by the ClipSeg model. This metric provided a quantifiable measure of the plant's size and growth rate, allowing us to track its development accurately throughout the observation period.

## 4. Analysis of Results

The plot shows an expected overall increasing trend in the kidney bean's growth over time, which corresponds to the natural growth pattern of the plant. The fluctuations observed in the plot are likely due to the rotation of leaves, which causes temporary changes in the leaf area captured by the images. These "jiggles" suggest that while the plant grows, its movement or changing orientation can impact the growth measurements.

## 5. Analysis of Vision Algorithms

In this project, we learned that normal image-only models can find the growing bean but can't label parts of the image by themselves or handle new objects they weren't trained on. On the other hand, models that use both pictures and text prompts are more flexible. They can label new things in images without being trained on them first, which is very useful for projects like ours where things change a lot.

## 6. Failed Experience with Segment Anything

We also explored the capabilities of the Segment Anything model [2] provided by META in a zero-shot fashion. The visualization results appeared very promising, showcasing the model's ability to generate segmentation masks with high fidelity. However, META has not open-sourced the multimodal Segment Anything model that accepts text prompts as input. Consequently, the output consists solely of masks without associated labels, rendering it challenging to distinguish which mask corresponds to the plant and which to the background. This limitation impeded our ability to apply the Segment Anything model effectively for our specific use case of monitoring kidney bean growth.
