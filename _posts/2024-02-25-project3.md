# Using Segment Anything Model (SAM) to Monitor Kidney Bean Growth


## 1. Introduction

This project explores the growth dynamics of a kidney bean plant through time-lapse photography. Motivated by a curiosity about plant growth and development, we aim to quantify the increase in the plant's size over time using semantic segmentation. The subject of our study, the kidney bean, was chosen for its relatively fast germination and growth process, making it an ideal candidate for a time-bound project.

To visualize and analyze the growth, we employ a semantic segmentation model that segments the plant from each image in a series of time-lapse photos. By calculating the area covered by the plant in each image, we can plot this data over time to observe the growth trend.

Our methodology and findings are shared with the hope that they may contribute to educational purposes and provide insights into plant growth patterns, potentially aiding in agricultural research.
