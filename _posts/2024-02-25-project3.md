## 1. Introduction

This project aims to leverage the Clip Segmentation (ClipSeg) [1] model to monitor the growth dynamics of a kidney bean plant through time-lapse photography. 

The grown kidney bean images are obtained from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCuXNmsNNac&t=0s).

Our code is available and reproducible at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12podIpmtLgJIvONrJQbTlwz_HUvaH5NV?usp=sharing).


## 2. Method

In this project, we utilized the ClipSeg [1] model, which combines the capabilities of both image understanding and natural language processing to perform segmentation tasks. ClipSeg takes an input image along with a text prompt and outputs a probability map that corresponds to the areas of the image described by the text prompt.

This approach allows for dynamic and flexible segmentation based on textual descriptions, enabling more accurate and relevant extraction of features from images.
Thus, we can use prompt like "plant" to monitor the growth magnitude of kidney bean in our selected video.

## 3. Results

To quantify the kidney bean's growth magnitude over time, we utilized the average value over the probability map generated by the ClipSeg model. 

This metric provided a quantifiable measure of the plant's size and growth rate, allowing us to track its development accurately throughout the observation period.

## 4. Analysis of Results

The plot shows an expected overall increasing trend in the kidney bean's growth over time, which corresponds to the natural growth pattern of the plant. 

The fluctuations observed in the plot are likely due to the rotation of leaves, which causes temporary changes in the leaf area captured by the images. 

These "jiggles" suggest that while the plant grows, its movement or changing orientation can impact the growth measurements.

## 5. Analysis of Vision Algorithms

Multimodal segmentation models, like ClipSeg, are highly promising for practical use due to their flexibility and zero-shot learning capabilities. 

These models can perform segmentation tasks without further fine-tuning, making them adaptable to various environments. 

## 6. Failed Experience with Segment Anything

We also explored the capabilities of the Segment Anything model [2] provided by Meta in a zero-shot fashion. 
The visualization results appeared promising, showing the model's high-quality zero-shot ability to generate segmentation masks.

    <em>Segmentation Masks Visualization using Segment Anything</em>
</div>

However, the output consists solely of masks without associated labels since Meta has not open-sourced the multimodal Segment Anything model that accepts text prompts as input, making it challenging to distinguish which mask corresponds to the plant and which to the background.


This limitation impeded our ability to apply the Segment Anything model to monitoring kidney bean growth.
