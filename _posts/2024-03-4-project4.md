# Rush to Top 10 in PlantTraits2024 - FGVC11 Competition

## 1. Introduction

The PlantTraits2024 Challenge, part of the FGVC11 workshop at CVPR 2024, seeks to harness the power of deep learning to predict six crucial plant traits from crowd-sourced images and ancillary data. The competition underscores the importance of understanding plant biodiversity and how plants adapt to climate change. By analyzing over 30,000 plant images, participants contribute to vital ecological research, helping to decipher global patterns in plant traits and their responses to environmental changes.

## 2. Competition Overview

### Goal

The primary goal is to predict plant traits such as leaf area and plant height using images and supplementary data. This challenge is pivotal for ecological research, offering insights into plant diversity, productivity, and resilience against climate change. It leverages a large dataset of citizen science photographs, combined with plant trait data, to explore the potential of artificial intelligence in ecological studies.

### Why It Matters

Understanding plant traits is essential for grasping ecosystem functions and their adaptability to climate change. This competition represents an opportunity to contribute to a broader comprehension of plant ecosystems, aiding in the prediction of how global changes might affect plant traits and ecosystems at large.

### Data and Approach

Participants are provided with over 30,000 labeled images and encouraged to use deep learning regression models, such as CNNs and Transformers, for prediction. The competition also integrates ancillary geodata to enhance model performance, including climate, soil, and satellite data. A multi-task learning approach, predicting multiple traits simultaneously, and the use of model ensembles are suggested to improve accuracy.

## 3. Our Method

We adopted a novel approach by implementing a log feature transformation combined with a clip backbone for model development. This strategy allowed us to effectively handle the diverse range of data and traits, accommodating the variability inherent in citizen science photographs and the complex relationships between different plant traits.

## 4. Results

Our method proved to be highly effective, securing us a place in the top 10 of the competition. This achievement not only highlights the potential of our approach but also contributes to the overarching goal of advancing our understanding of plant traits and their global patterns.

## Conclusion

Participating in the PlantTraits2024 Challenge has been a rewarding experience, allowing us to contribute to significant ecological research. By applying deep learning techniques to predict plant traits from photographs, we are part of an important effort to understand how plants adapt to changing climates and ecosystems.
