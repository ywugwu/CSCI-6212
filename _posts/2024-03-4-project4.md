# Rush to Top 10 in PlantTraits2024 - FGVC11 Competition

## 1. Introduction

This blog aims to provide a brief report of our approach in achieving the top 10 place in the PlantTraits2024 competition in a preliminary stage. All results were obtained before 4 March thus the leaderboard can change in the future.

The PlantTraits2024 Challenge, part of the FGVC11 workshop at CVPR 2024, provides 30,000 labeled images and also integrates ancillary geodata for predicting plant traits such as height, seed mass, leaf size, etc.

In this report, we will briefly introduce our proposed neural network model and some data preprocessing methods. Many technical details might be omitted in this report for the purpose of simplicity.

## 2. Our Method

Our model mainly consists of two parts: 1. utilizing a CLIP image encoder to extract image features, and 2. Concatenating the image feature with ancillary geodata and utilizing a shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP) to make final prediction.

To boost our ranking, we also employ some techniques that are commonly used in Kaggle competitions such as:

* Out-of-fold (OOF) Prediction
* Ensemble/Blending

## 3. A lot of Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering and Hyperparameter Tuning

By 4 March, our approach achieved 9th place out of about 150 teams.
