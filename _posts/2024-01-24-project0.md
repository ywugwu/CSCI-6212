# Assessing the Limitations of GPT-4's Vision Model

## 1. Introduction
This study briefly investigates the limitations of GPT-4's vision model. 

Despite its superior performance shown in multimodal context understanding, we wonder if GPT-4 would struggle with certain visual tasks, like its deficiency in tackling math problems. 

In this study, we locate two tasks: image matching and minor visual perturbation detection, that GPT-4 fails, and we show concrete examples in the following sections.



## 2. Image Matching
This task is formulated by a question: "From which part of image (1) is image (2) cropped?"

We ensure that image (2) is cropped from one of the left top, right top, left bottom, and right bottom of the image (1).

The motivation is humans can come up with the correct answer by a matching process, while neural networks are incapable of accomplishing such a process explicitly.

Therefore, even though it's a relatively simple task, it could be rather difficult for GPT4.

The following image shows that GPT4 **fails** for all four questions.

## 3. Perturbation Detection
This task is formulated by asking, "Are the two images identical? Do not use code analyzer."

By disabling GPT's code analyzer, we can see that GPT4's vision model can't distinguish minor difference between images.

    <em>Image (1) and Image (2) are identical while GPT4 returns "not identical"</em>

    <br>
    <em>Image (2) differs from image (1) by adding a small white patch. Although GPT4 returns "not identical", the reasons are incorrect and it doesn't discover the white patch we add.</em>

    <br>
    <em>Image (2) differs from image (1) by adding 5 small white patches. GPT4 only identifies 2 of them. </em>

## 4. Conclusion

This study reveals two main limitations in GPT-4's vision model: difficulty in precise image matching and perturbation detection.

GPT-4 fails both tasks which can be easily tackled by explicit rule-based algorithms. 

1. **Image Matching:** GPT-4 struggles with locating the exact region from which a sub-image is cropped. This is likely due to its design, which excels in pattern recognition and context interpretation, but not in tasks requiring spatial analysis. The model's approach to image understanding is based on identifying and interpreting global features rather than focusing on precise spatial relationships within the image.

2. **Perturbation Detection:** The model also shows limitations in detecting minor alterations in images. This can be attributed to its training, which emphasizes on broader context and patterns over minute, localized changes. Such a limitation indicates a gap in its ability to recognize subtle variations that are often critical in fields like medical imaging or quality control.

In conclusion, while GPT-4 demonstrates remarkable abilities in general image analysis and understanding, it falls short in tasks requiring exact spatial awareness and minor detail detection. These findings suggest areas for future improvement and specialization in AI vision models.
