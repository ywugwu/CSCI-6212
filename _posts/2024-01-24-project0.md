# Assessing GPT-4's Image Understanding Limitations

## Introduction
This study briefly investigates the limitations of GPT-4's vision model. 

Despite its superior performance shown in multimodal context understanding, we wonder if GPT-4 would struggle with certain visual tasks, like its deficiency in tackling math problems. 

In this study, we locate three tasks: object counting, image matching, and minor visual perturbation detection that GPT-4 fails, and we show concrete examples in the following sections.


## Hard Tasks for GPT4's Vision Model
### Object Counting
We define the object counting task as asking `how many **[some specific object]** are in this image.` 

For example, **we can ask "how many colors are in this image":**


### Image Matching
This task is formulated by a question: "From which part of image (1) is image (2) cropped?"

We ensure that image (2) is cropped from one of the left top, right top, left bottom, and right bottom of the image (1).

The motivation is humans can come up with the correct answer by a matching process, while neural networks are incapable of accomplishing such a process explicitly.

Therefore, even though it's a relatively simple task, it should be rather difficult for GPT4.

The following image shows that GPT4 fails for all four questions.

### Perturbation Detection
This task is formulated by a question: "Is image (1) and image (2) different?"
